# Spring Sandbox

This application is my playground for trying/testing different technologies.

## Build and deploy

The create-and-publish-image GitHub Action builds a docker image base on the Dockerfile and pushes it to the GitHub
Container Registry. The built image can be then deployed using some container engine e.g. like Docker or Podman.
